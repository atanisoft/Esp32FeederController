Make sure to select 0.8mm thick PCB

You will need a thin PCB cut along the silkscreen lines with tin snips or scissors.
If those silkscreen lines were V-CUT it would cost more than triple the price due to the small PCB size.

And, add this to the comments for the PCB:

Please V-CUT as indicated in the Eco1_User gerber file.
